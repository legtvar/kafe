## `Error` & `Err<T>` (2023-10-11)

To (eventually) avoid leaking .NET abstraction through the API (for example by the `SemanticExceptionFilter`), we use the `Error` and `Err<T>`. `Err<T>` can be either `T` or one or more `Error`s.
These are then passed out of a method through its return value.
This forces the caller to deal with the errors that can occur or pass them upwards.
The API should send then the error(s) along with the proper http code.
Eventually we should to remove the `SemanticExceptionFilter` and treat all exceptions as internal server errors (500).
