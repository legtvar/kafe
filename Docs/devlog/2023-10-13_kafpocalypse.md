# Kafpocalypse

I accidentally dropped the production DB.
Thankfully, I found a snapshot I made in September for testing purposes.
Since no changes after FFFIMU23 were desirable, it doesn't really matter if we dropped them.
We did, however, lose metadata of the generated video variants.
I'll solve it later.
