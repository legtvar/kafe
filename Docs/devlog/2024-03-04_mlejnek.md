# `mlejnek` (2024-03-04)

Since I need to describe the process of creating KAFE's new VM to the admins of LEMMA RS, I might as well put it here:

KAFE's new home is called `mlejnek` and it is a VM in [Stratus.FI](https://www.fi.muni.cz/tech/unix/stratus.html).
It has these specs:

- Debian 12
- 8 GB RAM
- 2 GB of swap space
- 64 GB system storage
- 2 TB archive storage

We use the following software for KAFE's basic operation:

- _GitLab Runner_ for running CI jobs.
- _Docker_ for KAFE's individual containers.
- _Portainer_ for management of Docker containers.
- _Traefik_ as a reverse proxy configured by container labels. It also obtains certs from Let's Encrypt.
- _FFMpeg_ as a provider of video metadata and for converting videos.

Once we had this basic setup, we communicated with CVT FI to set up the following services:

- Put the VM into production mode:
  - Get a public IPv4 and IPv6.
  - Change the owner of the VM to an employee of FI.
  - Set up _Nagios_ for automatic notification of downtime.
  - Point `kafe-stage.fi.muni.cz` at the VM.
- New group in faculty administration, `adm_kafe`, that manages `mail_kafe`.
- New group in GitLab - `LeGTVaR` - that is synced to `mail_kafe`.
- _Bacula_ to backup of the archival storage and the VM itself through.
- CNAME records for `kafe-stage.fi.muni.cz` and `kafe.lemma.fi.muni.cz`. Both point to `kafe.fi.muni.cz`

Finally for the Games extension, we contacted ICS MU, who then pointed `games.muni.cz` to a nameserver of FI.
CVT then added a CNAME from `games.muni.cz` to `kafe.fi.muni.cz`.
