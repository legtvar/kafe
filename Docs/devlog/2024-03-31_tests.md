## Tests (2024-03-31)

I set up tests [Alba](https://jasperfx.github.io/alba/) for the API endpoints.
Each test run creates its own schema in the DB.
CI is configured to spawn its own postgres container just to have something to run tests agains.
The first endpoints to tests are those from the _Accounts_ group.
I already found a bug with (lack of) email validation when creating a new account.
