# Docs in Lume

I decided to use [Lume](https://lume.land) to power the KAFE docs instead of Docfx.
I used it before for [visitlab web](https://visitlab.fi.muni.cz/), my own site, and some others.
It has just a really pleasant developer experience, let's me do all sorts of stuff to the resulting HTML -- like syntax highlighting at build time -- and overall is a better tool to work with than Docfx.
On the other hand, it doesn't generate an API reference for C# nor TS, which is something I'll work on later.

To run the docs locally with Docker use this:

```bash
docker build -f ./Docs.Dockerfile --build-arg PREFIX=/docs -t kafe-docs .
docker run --rm -it -p 8080:80 kafe-docs
```

(`PREFIX` is set to `/docs` by default, so you don't actually have to write it above.
It is used since the docs are hosted at [`https://kafe.fi.muni.cz/docs`](https://kafe.fi.muni.cz/docs)).
