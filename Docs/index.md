# KAFE

**K**ontrol and **A**rchival of **F**antastic **E**ntertainment

KAFE is an archival system for multimedia.
It's made up of an API and a web app that's using it.
We built it to organize our projects at [FI MU](https://www.fi.muni.cz/), capture their development, and present them
to the public.
