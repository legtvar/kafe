The territorial and quantitative scope of the license is unlimited. Authorisations are granted for the entire duration of the respective rights.</11><12>Recommendation:</12><13>Verify in time that the YouTube platform does not detect copyright infringement in your video</13><14>If you need to prove to the YouTube platform that you hold the license rights to the used material, contact us at festival-tech@fi.muni.cz</14>",
